# GraphemeColor_SynaesthesiaSimulator
This bit of code mimics synaesthetic visual perception, for synaesthetes. You need to generate your own grapheme color dictionary however (the sample here is MyColors.csv, based on mine).
The dictionary is based on 8 bit color. If any graphic artists or synaethetes have suggestions or opinions on improving this, please contact me:
